# Where's Waldo Application using ReactJS and Firebase.

This is a hidden object game where the objective is find all the missing characters.

The style is very basic as I wanted to create a minimum viable product as soon as possible. 

To create a leaderboard, I used Firestore Database to store player's time and name. The leaderboard will only be shown after the player completely find all characters.

## Things I learned:

I learned how to create a Firestore Database and how to read and write to the database.
I learned to use the useRef hook in React.

## Additional notes: 

This is my first time building a complex app like this so it was really a fun experience.
I need to improve my designing skills as the design is very bland.
